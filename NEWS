Added the --enable-cbc check to configure

---- Wedensday 03rd December 2014 -

Updated dnsa so we can remove glue zones. Also added ability to add a .
at the end of the NS name if it contains the FQDN - otherwise this will
append the domain name to the end.

---- Sunday 30th November 2014 ----

Updated the autoconf configure.ac file - using the m4 directory to store
macros to check for libraries installed. This will be of use when we
start to add more libraries to be linked.

---- Monday 11th February 2012 ----

Release version 0.2.1 contains the new look cmdb. The database interface
has been modularised so that either sqlite or mysql can be used, and
also starting to use prepared statements.
There have been some other code clean ups too.
The 0.2.x branch will concentrate on the modularised structure for 
cbc and dnsa.

---- Friday 25th January 2013 -----

To celebrate Burns night this is the first release of the cmdb programs
using autoconf

 This 3 suites of programs will allow you to keep track of servers in your
estate and create individual build files for the servers, whilst being able to
maintain DNS records for the servers. Let's describe the 3 suites now

#####
#
# cmdb
#
#####

 cmdb will store configuration details about your servers, and these details
will be used to create automatic build files for your servers. Details stored
include hardware details (include the MAC address of the network card; useful
for network booting!) and switch / power ports and rack locations. You can
group servers by customer, which can be an external customer or an internal
customer, for example a specific project. You can also store the serial numbers
and hardware types.

#####
#
# dnsa
#
#####

 dnsa allows you manipulate DNS records for your servers and the services that
run on them. It will also automatically build the reverse DNS zones, based on
the forward names in DNS. For IP addresses that have multiple forward records
you can choose a preferrred A record. 

#####
#
# cbc
#
####

 The cbc suite allows you to create multiple configurations for server builds.
There is multiple OS support, you can create partition schemes, build varients
that can be used to install different server types, e.g. web, database, mail.
You can also configure base OS services, such as logging, authentication types,
NTP, monitoring services, smtp relay, and locales and languages. The cbc
program will create the DHCP and TFTP configuration to allow network booting of
your servers, as well as the build configuration file for either preseed or
kickstart build types.

This software package will build 3 programs which are documented below.

CMDB: Configuration Management Database

cmdb stores information about your servers that can be useful in the
administration of your estate of servers. For example you can assign hardware
to the server and store other pieces of information about your servers
(datacenter, power outlets, network ports etc). You can also assign your
servers to customers (projects) so that they can be grouped into logical
containers.

CBC: Create Build Configuration

cbc takes hardware information stored in cmdb and uses it to create a build
script for your server, along with various options stored in CBC itself
(build domain for IP address, Operating system / Version / Architecture) and
also various bits of configuration that you may wish to perform on a new
server build (NTP setup, LDAP Authentication etc. For a full list please see
the man pages.) It will also interact with external programs needed to
automate a build (TFTP and DHCPD for network boot). The build file will be
placed in an apropriate sub-directory of your apache base directory for
distribution to the building server via HTTP.

DNSA: Domain Name System Administration

dnsa aims to be front end administration software for the BIND DNS. It uses
a mysql database to store the records for your various domains and contains
programs to be able to write out these zone files and create the configuration
files that BIND uses.

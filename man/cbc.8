.SH NAME
cbc \- Create Build Config
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cbc
[
.B action
] ( -n | -i | -i )
.B <server specifier>
[
.B build options
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcbc\fP allows you to create preseed and kickstart files for the debian
preseed server build system, and the redhat kickstart build system.
It will also create the needed TFTP and DHCP configuration files to allow for
network booting.
You are able to configure many aspects of build, including the Operating System
type, version and the architecture on which it will run.
You can also configure the partition scheme, locale and the packages installed
on the system, which we call a build \fIvarient\fP.
There is also a semi-automatic network configuration system, called
\fIbuild domains\fP which do the job of assigning IP addresses to the build
configuration.
.PP
Please see the end of this man page for the manual pages for the ancillary
programs which allow you to create the templates for all of these build
options.

only \fIi386\fP and \fIx86_64\fP (amd64) are supported.
.IP "-b <build domain>"
This is the name of the build domain the server build is to be a part of.
.IP "-x <varient>"
This is the build varient. This will contain a list of packages to install

mysql, ldap etc.
.IP "-e <locale_id>"
This is the database locale_id of the locale you wish to have enabled on the
server.
This provides the information for the locale setting, as well as the
timezone and keyboard mappings.
You can create multiple combinations of these such as AU keymap but CEST
timezone and PL locale, for example.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcbcvarient\fP is used to define build varients based on the packages to
install.
Thus, you can create a web server build containing packages like apache and
various php modules, or an email server contain the specific email services you
would like to provide.
Each varient is based on a particular OS and version, due to the package names
being different between the various OS's.
You will need to know the precise package names you wish to add the build
varient, as these will be placed in the build file, and if the package name
does not exist the build will fail.
\fBcbcvarient\fP is used to create the template names for a build varient;
use \fBcbcpack\fP to actually add packages to the build varient.

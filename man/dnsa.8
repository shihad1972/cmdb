.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdnsa\fP is a tool to administer DNS zones and records. You are able to add
individual zones and records, and also to add reverse zones and build those
reverse zones based on what your forward zones look like. If you have multiple
records pointing to one IP address, you can choose a preferred record for the
PTR record for that IP address. dnsa does assume some working knowledge of DNS
(i.e. what record types are used for etc), but the main goal is to simplify
the administration of DNS. This can be useful even in a small to medium size
organisation where you can have multiple sub-domains for different departments.
dnsa tries not to limit you too much in your choices, and to give you a 
flexible and powerful tool to organise your DNS infrastructure. It should be
installed on the DNS server itself.

.PP
.IP "-n zone name / network range
The name of the DNS zone / domain for forward zones or the IP range for
reverse zones.
.PP
.B Options for adding a reverse zone
.IP "-p prefix"
The subnet prefix for a reverse zone. Regular classes (/8, /16 or /24)
or classless prefixes (/24 -> /32) will be accepted. Classless prefixes
between /8 -> /16 and /16 -> /24 will NOT be accepted.
.PP
.B Options for adding a forward host
.IP "-i IP address"
This is the destination of the record. If this is an A record type, then this
will be the IP address of the host. If this is a CNAME then this will be the
FQDN of the destination of the CNAME. Use the FQDN even if the CNAME points to
an A record in the same domain.
.IP "-t record type"
This is the record type (A, MX, CNAME etc)
.IP "-h host"
This is the host name of the record.
.IP "-p priority (specifically for MX records)"
When adding an MX record this is the priority of the MX record.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcbcos\fP is software to add new versions of operating systems to the build
system.
You are able to specify the version number and architecture type.
Currently there are only 2 architecture types, \fIi386\fP and \fIx86_64\fP.
You are also able to specify the version alias for debian based distros, where
each version has a code name, such as \fIsqueeze\fP for version \fI6\fP, or in
the ubuntu world, \fIprecise\fP for version \fI12.04\fP.
These are required for debian based builds but are optional for redhat based
builds.
You are able to add, display, list and remove build operating systems.
Currently the \fBcbc\fP system supports the following operating systems:
\fIdebian, ubuntu\fP and \fIcentos\fP. Soon there will be support for
\fIredhat\fP.
\fBcbcos\fP will also download the boot files for the OS from the mirror
server. You can refresh these boot files using the \fI-g\fP option. You can
specify a specific OS version if you wish, but you do not have to.

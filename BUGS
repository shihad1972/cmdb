Cannot remove hardware from a server

Modifying the OS in cbc does not update the locale so still used the old locale

Ubuntu build has security.ubuntu.org added by fill_kernel() function

Still seeing issues with locale and adding a new OS version.

Also, need to think about returning an error when no records
exist in one of the tables. If I am doing a multiple_query it
will be hard to know which one.

Unable to remove SRV record - hostname invalid (probably due to _tcp in the
name)

When displaying specific OS, if it is not found then the top of the
table is still printed. This should wait until we have found an
os.

security.ubuntu.org does not exist, so we should not add this to the
sources.list file for anything apart from a debian build.

When removing config for a package in a domain, I should be able to remove
all configs instead of having to identfy each field. Perhaps have another
command line argument to show I want to delete all the configs

check_parent_for_a_record() in zones.c should return 1 if record found not 0

Foreign keys are not working in sqlite. This is due to the fact that they need
to be specifically enabled. In cbcsysp I have turned them on for the delete. I
should probably do this for update as well. Needs done on cmdb and also dnsa.
 *** FIXED added to the base sqlite open rw function ***

cbcvarient is not honouring the -t <arch> when listing

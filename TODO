When adding package to varient, we need to check if the package already
exists in that varient and not add it again. IDEMPOTENT
	** Done. Commit ID: 51dcd4e **

When displaying build OS, it would be useful to know what servers are
built with that OS.
Also display does not honour -o <os_version> nor -t <architecture>

11/07/2020
Should be able to read config values from environment variables. Also
have defaults either in config file, environment or database

02/07/2020
Fix cbcvarient where displaying varient that does not exist blows up.

28/06/2020
The cmdb_add_*_id_to_list functions are inconsistent. Some fail if they do
not find what they are searching for. Should maybe have a wrapper function
for them if we want to be _sure_ there the server is added. Could probably
do this when consolidating these functions doing note 24/06/2020.

27/06/2020
It would be useful to have extra functions for the list(clone being an example)

24/06/2020
Consolidate the cmdb_add_*_id_to_list into 2 functions:
	1 for char *
	1 for char **
Have to be careful of the char ** one; Need to tell length of list. Maybe end
with NULL pointer at the end of list?

 Strange bug when building reverse zones with newly set preferred A record.
It does not add the record in on the first time the zone is built, only on
the 2nd time it is built.

06/06/2020
Should probably move all actions to the CMDB_ definitions. These are in
ailsacmdb.h and will remove another dependency on cmdb.h

06/05/2020
In the sqlite setup functions (ailsa_setup_rw_sqlite and ailsa_setup_ro_sqlite)
need to stop exiting in these functions. They should pass their error back up
the function stack

05/05/2020
cbcscript is tightly tied into the build_type table; also the system_scripts_args
table has too much information in it. It would be better to be like system
packages where there is an args and a conf table.

03/05/2020
Need to fix the error returns, as report_error does not free memory in use
before exiting. The error report function should only report an error.
The error code should be able to 'bubble up' from whatever function had an
error, and get back to main, so we can free memory there

03/05/2020
Adding a system package in cbcsysp should not automatically configure the
package. Indeed, it should check if the package is in the varient. This will
obviously fail for packaes that are part of a base install, and so those
packages should be added to the base varient.

20/04/2020
 When adding a locale, need to check if that locale already exists

19/04/2020
 When adding packages, I need to check if the package already exists for
that particular varient and OS combination.

10/04/2020
When grabbing kernel and initrd boot files, a summary of download speed
should be printed.
	** This is hipster bullshit. Fuck off! **

04/04/2020
Programs moved to new AILLIST database model:
	cmdb		**Done**
	dnsa
	cbc
	cbcvarient	**Done**
	cbcdomain	**Done**
	cbcos		**Done**
	cbcsysp		**Done**
	cbcscript	**Done**
	cbcpart		**Done**
	cbclocale	**Done**

Add support for a YAML data file, so we do not have the unwieldy command
line options. Once this is up and working, this can be the default data
definition language for the daemon too.

Reworking the SQL code:
  - allow inserts of multiple entries
  - condense cmdb dnsa and cbc sql into 1 set of functions

07/02/2020
Start to use the errors.c in lib/ directory. cmdb-0.3 branch has put the
base_sql.h header file into include/

27/02/2019
Need to add a generic logging function, that can handle both console
output and also logging to syslog.

09/11/2018
Deleting SRV records is tricky; it seems to delete all SRV records
for a given service (e.g. ldap) and we cannot specify which one
to delete

06/03/2016
I should probably have a default configuration file, and use make to create
it and then have make install install it in ${sysconfdir}/cmdb. Using the
configmake header, I can then work out where this is supposed to be.
This will probably be less necessary when I move to a daemon for the main
work, and the command line programs just contact the daemon to do the work,
as the daemon can have a config file passed to it on startup.
	*** Update: 07/03/2016 ***
	Install script cmdb.sh now takes into account the values in
	configmake.h

24/02/2016
Add default for build_os, partition and varient

03/03/2015
I want to get rid of the need to have a server already in the database before
adding a build. This would mean extending the ethernet and hard-disk options
when creating the build to be able to add the server and requisite hardware
into the database before creating the build. Of course if the server and
or hardware is already in the database, then that will be fine.

27/02/2015  **** FANTASIC IDEA. NEED TO IMPLEMENT SOON *****
Should probably get rid of cbcos. Should check if we have an alias in
build_type and we can add the bt_id into the build table and remove
os_id.
	*** Add: Can even just have versions in build_os; no need to have
	name and alias; Have those in build_type and then refernce from
	build_os

18/02/2015
Need to get rid of the search / extended search in dnsa and cmdb

31/01/2015
Need to check all programs are checking for ~/.dnsa.conf and also add
the -c <confg-file> option

06/01/2015
I want to be able to limit the number of results returned from the DB query
so we only display, say, 20 servers / dnsa zone records etc. This will mean
we need to page the terminal and also rerun the query on the database using
the LIMIT clause in the SQL statement. This can be used in the prepared
statements but probably not the base queries, so I will have to fix the whole
DB access :(

21/11/2014
Check the auditd source code for a cool way to read a config file.
Have to build a list of values that it can read, and will
probably want to associate these with the struct char memeber somehow.
Currently config reading is pretty ugly :(
Also need to add the ENV options too - should be able to get the
values from environment.

20/10/2014
Need to add racks, switches and power outlets into the database. Also maybe
need external storage arrays, tape drives etc. Perhaps move servers table
into asset table?

17/10/2014
Need to break out the address for customer from the main customer table. This
will be to allow multiple customer addresses / sites. Would we want to be able
to assign a service to a site? What about hardware?

10/08/2014 - Part III
Would be good to be able to lock down the preseed file and host script to only 
that IP address. As this is HTTP this will have to be in the apache config.

10/08/2014 - Part II
I should split out the generic arguments into double dashes -- , but also be
able to read them from a config file; one per line
Will need to work out priority for system config and user config

10/08/2014
Might be good to have a version of cbc that can work without cmdb. I will need 
to distill it down to the esentials of the build. Will need to investigate
-- arguments to command line for the partitions

		 base + varient
		/
varient / package 
		\
		 what base? how to choose..

	 size of the disk
	/
partition		     specific part's, but can still choose
	\		    /
	 specific partitions?

		 Do I have to specify supported OS's?
		/

	 Mostly IP's, mostly + DNS
	/

cpc	create preseed config
ckc	create kickstart config
**** Basic version of cpc has been written ****
**** Basic version of ckc has been written ****

09/08/2014
Need to be able to update / modify in cmdb. I will need to the add the
updates to the database.
*** Server complete 16/10/2014 ***
*** Customer and services seem complete too ***

02/06/2014
Need to add support for internal / external views.

17/04/2014
The applications in build domain should be associated with a "system" group
of packages, separate from the "application" packages currently in the
packages table. In preseed this would allow me to create a table that can
have entries added to them by the user; the package names and the debconf
configurations for those packages, as this is what the build domain
applications currently do. For kickstart, there would be a configuration
script associated with them. Can also have a config script associated
with preseed.
*** Maybe fixed? cbcsysp and cbcscript ***

29/03/2014
If I change the id field in the database to a uuid then I can have
a local file storage, i.e. not use a database. If I am to do this
it may be helpful to be able to import and export these fields in
raw text. libxml anyone?

23/11/2013
Allow mysql to be network aware, so that we can have multiple build
servers. We could do this by adding a build_server table and then
build_server_id (or a snappier name) to the server table. This can
then be added to the end of the SQL statement to be more precise
about the result returned. We could also use this to add enable /
disable instead of delete in the database.

19/09/2013
Only need one initial customer; techies. Need to think more about
internal customers; again most of the crap should be able to be added
later

The base.sh install script for debian could download a config script
for that host using the hostname.
Fixed

15/09/2013
When addding a server, it's bullshit that we have to add the network
card and hard disk seperately, and also that we have to know the ID's
that they are in the database. Better to add them WHEN we add the
server.

Need to add Root-CA field into the build_domain table of database.

**Need to add default locale when we add a build OS.

**Debian build want's configuration for libnss-ldap and libpam-ldap if
  we do not automatically configure them.
Fixed

26/08/2013
Add checks against all strtoul from DB as if given NULL it will segfault.

07/08/2013
Use amd64 instead of x86_64 - perhaps alias? (this is for the tftp names)

30/06/2013
Have a generic config struct (config_s) that all the others (e.g.
dnsa_config_s) contain that can be shared between the programs. This way we
can have standard SQL functions that can be shared amongst the programs.

Problem with this is to work out a way of passing the program to the SQL
search so that it will do a, e.g. cbc_search and get the correct values
for number and type of args and fields. Also this will need to be the
correct search itself. Could this config contain this information?
	** Started. ailsa_cmdb_s **

05/06/2013
Need to add the first zone in for dnsa otherwise the software complains
it cannot add the zone due to the A records for the NS records are not
in the zone. DOH!
	03/08/2013 **UPDATE **
	I could probably just add the name server(s) as A records into
	the DB and then add these records to the zonefile. If you are
	adding a zone there should not be any records yet.

04/06/2013
For all build options there should be a default option so when you
create a build you do not need to specify all the options.
This will help for first install too, if I create some default options

02/06/2013
Should have the root password for the machine in the database and
add this to the build file. Need to work out how to get hash

Also need to add an email alias for root in smtp configuration
	06/11/2015 **UPDATE**
	The package configuration for postfix is supposed to do this, but
	only seems to work in stretch (and not jessie nor wheezy)

06/05/2013
Database access is pretty poor. Multiple inserts need multiple statements
and the memory allocation for a large result set is bad too (each result
has an individual malloc.)

28/04/2013
The varients perhaps should be able to be added together, so for example you
can create a cluster varient that will install all the packages necessary
for a cluster as well as , e.g., LAMP or SQL Database.

This functionality could be added with "add on" packages

06/04/2013
Allow packages to be grouped, so e.g. PHP can contain all php modules

Should probably add racks / power points / switch points into cmdb.

*** ALL ***
Need to sort out an install script for the database and decide what tables
to populate at install time, and how to get the default values from the user
Currently I am thinking make postinstall or perhaps make dbinstall

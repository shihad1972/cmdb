Currently we can query a mysql database. Values can be taken from a config
file, which for the moment has to be /etc/dnsa/dnsa/conf

So we can write the zone files (forward and reverse) and also write the
config files for these forward and reverse zones. This includes some sanity
checking of the zonefiles and config files.

**** Features *****
** Add records to the database - use ncurses?
** Automatically create reverse zone(s) in the database (via cron??)
** Specify different config file on command line
** Add install script (/usr/local most likely)

**** Coding *****
** Farm out config file reading to a separate function in a lib.

Allow packages to be grouped, so e.g. PHP can contain all php modules

Should probably add racks / power points / switch points into cmdb.

Need to removed the country, keymap and language from build domain for cbc. 
This will include remove the columns from the database and also all the 
database calls in cbc and cbcdomain. I think I should move this into the build
table, so it is linked to the build and not the build domain


*** DNSA ***

Need to check the pcre checks. Still we are missing some ifdef libpcre
statements. Also none of the below programs are checking thier input.

*** CBC ***
I want to split out the various parts of the build configuration into separate
commands, so for example to add / delete / display build domains use
cbcbuilddomain, or perhaps cbcbuildd or cbcbdom, cbcos for OS's etc
*** Partially done: we have
cbcdomain
cbcos
cbcvarient
cbcpack

still need:
cbcpart
cbclocale

*** ALL ***
Need to sort out and install script for the database and decide what tables
to populate at install time, and how to get the default values from the user
Currently I am thinking make postinstall or perhaps make dbinstall

Also I will need to write man pages for each command....

I need to write a proper error function if the fields in the SELECT statement
are not equal to the specified fields. At the moment it just breaks the loop
*** Fixed *** reports an error (for some of them)

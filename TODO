Adding new OS is not complete. There is no locale for the new OS so we
cannot use it. This is error 190

21/04/2014
With the checks.[c|h] should add a glib test as well so we do not have to
use libpcre. Can have the option of one or the other. ./configure should
bomb out if neither are present but give the user the option to pass
paramemter --with-usr-input-checks=disabled

The applications in build domain should be associated with a "system" group
of packages, separate from the "application" packages currently in the
packages table. In preseed this would allow me to create a table that can
have entries added to them by the user; the package names and the debconf
configurations for those packages, as this is what the build domain
applications currently do. For kickstart, there would be a configuration
script associated with them. Can also have a config script associated
with preseed.

If I change the id field in the database to a uuid then I can have
a local file storage, i.e. not use a database. If I am to do this
it may be helpful to be able to import and export these fields in
raw text. libxml anyone?

When adding anything to the database, need to check if the name
already exists.

02/02/2014
When adding a reverse slave zone, the insert takes it from the config
file resulting in incorrect primary and secondary name severs in the
database. Although this does not affect the functionality of the slave
zone it looks untidy in the database. Forward zones seem to handle this
better.
Fixed 05/05/2014 Version 0.2.17.4

Also, we do not need the name to be provided when adding slave zones.
We should be able to do an DNS lookup on either the IP address or the
name

Using cbc to add a build, if there is an error on the command line
it still adds somthing into the build tables, as adding the correct
one and trying to write the build file results in an error. Perhaps
should look at doing this as a transaction (sort of).

Also i want to be able to use -n <domain> in dnsa -w [ -F | -R ]

23/11/2013
Allow mysql to be network aware, so that we can have multiple build
servers. We could do this by adding a build_server table and then
build_server_id (or a snappier name) to the server table. This can
then be added to the end of the SQL statement to be more precise
about the result returned. We could also use this to add enable /
disable instead of delete in the database.

19/09/2013
Only need one initial customer; techies. Need to think more about
internal customers; again most of the crap should be able to be added
later

The base.sh install script for debian could download a config script
for that host using the hostname.

Start using proper error(s) from the functions I call

15/09/2013
When addding a server, it's bullshit that we have to add the network
card and hard disk seperately, and also that we have to know the ID's
that they are in the database. Better to add them WHEN we add the
server.

Need to add Root-CA field into the build_domain table of database.

**Need to add default locale when we add a build OS.
**Debian build want's configuration for libnss-ldap and libpam-ldap if
  we do not automatically configure them.

01/09/2013
Need to check for overlaps in build_domains when adding a new one.
Also if we want to add a dhcpd.network entry will probably need to check
if one exists already, and also configuration of the IP on that network.
We could always assume /24, but this will not always be the case.

26/08/2013
Add checks against all strtoul from DB as if given NULL it will segfault.

Also need to add server deletion; check for builds and delete this as well

08/08/2013
When adding or deleting a build domain then re-write the dhcpd.networks
configuration file with all valid build domains. Will need to assume that
the tftp host is also the DNS host.

07/08/2013
Use amd64 instead of x86_64 - perhaps alias? (this is for the tftp names)

30/06/2013
Have a generic config struct (config_s) that all the others (e.g.
dnsa_config_s) contain that can be shared between the programs. This way we
can have standard SQL functions that can be shared amongst the programs.

Problem with this is to work out a way of passing the program to the SQL
search so that it will do a, e.g. cbc_search and get the correct values
for number and type of args and fields. Also this will need to be the
correct search itself. Could this config contain this information?

15/06/2013
When adding new build_os need to add locales for that os. Should probably
base on build type

05/06/2013
Need to add the first zone in for dnsa otherwise the software complains
it cannot add the zone due to the A records for the NS records are not
in the zone. DOH!
	03/08/2013 **UPDATE **
	I could probably just add the name server(s) as A records into
	the DB and then add these records to the zonefile. If you are
	adding a zone there should not be any records yet.

04/06/2013
For all build options there should be a default option so when you
create a build you do not need to specify all the options.
This will help for first install too, if I create some default options

02/06/2013
Should have the root password for the machine in the database and
add this to the build file. Need to work out how to get hash

Also need to add an email alias for root in smtp configuration

23/05/2013
Still need to write cbclocale

06/05/2013
Database access is pretty poor. Multiple inserts need multiple statements
and the memory allocation for a large result set is bad too (each result
has an individual malloc.)

28/04/2013
The varients perhaps should be able to be added together, so for example you
can create a cluster varient that will install all the packages necessary
for a cluster as well as , e.g., LAMP or SQL Database.

This functionality could be added with "add on" packages

20/04/2013
Add timestamps and uids to database. One for creation, one for
modification

06/04/2013
Allow packages to be grouped, so e.g. PHP can contain all php modules

Should probably add racks / power points / switch points into cmdb.


*** DNSA ***

Need to check the pcre checks. Still we are missing some ifdef libpcre
statements. Also none of the below programs are checking thier input.

*** ALL ***
Need to sort out an install script for the database and decide what tables
to populate at install time, and how to get the default values from the user
Currently I am thinking make postinstall or perhaps make dbinstall

I need to write a proper error function if the fields in the SELECT statement
are not equal to the specified fields. At the moment it just breaks the loop
This is in the search function using the dbdata_s struct.
*** Fixed *** reports an error (for some of them)
Actually this at the moment just returns NO_TYPE and the functions do not even
check the return code. Not sure how this is being passed up the function stack.

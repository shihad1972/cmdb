Need to add the first zone in for dnsa otherwise the software complains
it cannot add the zone due to the A records for the NS records are not
in the zone. DOH!

For all build options there should be a default option so when you
create a build you do not need to specify all the options.
This will help for first install too, if I create some default options

Should have the root password for the machine in the database and
add this to the build file. Need to work out how to get hash

Also need to add an email alias for root in smtp configuration

Need to be able to add glue records to DNS zone files. Could check
on NS records that have . in them??

Still need to write cbclocale

12/05/2013
Update the cbc options as they are out of date

Database access is pretty poor. Multiple inserts need multiple statements
and the memory allocation for a large result set is bad too (each result
has an individual malloc.)

The varients perhaps should be able to be added together, so for example you
can create a cluster varient that will install all the packages necessary
for a cluster as well as , e.g., LAMP or SQL Database.

This functionality could be added with "add on" packages

20/04/2013
Add timestamps and uids to database. One for creation, one for
modification

06/04/2013
Allow packages to be grouped, so e.g. PHP can contain all php modules

Should probably add racks / power points / switch points into cmdb.

Need to removed the country, keymap and language from build domain for cbc. 
This will include remove the columns from the database and also all the 
database calls in cbc and cbcdomain. I think I should move this into the build
table, so it is linked to the build and not the build domain


*** DNSA ***

Need to check the pcre checks. Still we are missing some ifdef libpcre
statements. Also none of the below programs are checking thier input.

****** Done (bar cbclocale) May 2013 *******************
*** CBC ***
I want to split out the various parts of the build configuration into separate
commands, so for example to add / delete / display build domains use
cbcbuilddomain, or perhaps cbcbuildd or cbcbdom, cbcos for OS's etc
*** Partially done: we have
cbcdomain
cbcos
cbcvarient
cbcpack

still need:
cbcpart
cbclocale
********************************************************

*** ALL ***
Need to sort out an install script for the database and decide what tables
to populate at install time, and how to get the default values from the user
Currently I am thinking make postinstall or perhaps make dbinstall

Also I will need to write man pages for each command....

I need to write a proper error function if the fields in the SELECT statement
are not equal to the specified fields. At the moment it just breaks the loop
*** Fixed *** reports an error (for some of them)

Have a generic config struct (config_s) that all the others (e.g.
dnsa_config_s) contain that can be shared between the programs. This way we
can have standard SQL functions that can be shared amongst the programs.

Problem with this is to work out a way of passing the program to the SQL
search so that it will do a, e.g. cbc_search and get the correct values
for number and type of args and fields. Also this will need to be the
correct search itself. Could this config contain this information?

When adding new build_os need to add locales for that os. Should probably
base on build type

13/06/2013
Need to add the slave zones to dnsa and also add  the ability to have
glue records in a zone. Should probably also check what kind of types
of records we can hold.

06/06/2013 ** DONE ** 04/07/2013
Need to define an autoconf macro for HAVE_DNSA so users can disable this
if they so want

05/06/2013
Need to add the first zone in for dnsa otherwise the software complains
it cannot add the zone due to the A records for the NS records are not
in the zone. DOH!

For all build options there should be a default option so when you
create a build you do not need to specify all the options.
This will help for first install too, if I create some default options

02/06/2013
Should have the root password for the machine in the database and
add this to the build file. Need to work out how to get hash

Also need to add an email alias for root in smtp configuration

01/06/2013
Need to be able to add glue records to DNS zone files. Could check
on NS records that have . in them??

23/05/2013
Still need to write cbclocale

12/05/2013
Update the cbc options as they are out of date
*** Fixed (i am pretty sure, anyway) ***

Database access is pretty poor. Multiple inserts need multiple statements
and the memory allocation for a large result set is bad too (each result
has an individual malloc.)

28/04/2013
The varients perhaps should be able to be added together, so for example you
can create a cluster varient that will install all the packages necessary
for a cluster as well as , e.g., LAMP or SQL Database.

This functionality could be added with "add on" packages

20/04/2013
Add timestamps and uids to database. One for creation, one for
modification

06/04/2013
Allow packages to be grouped, so e.g. PHP can contain all php modules

Should probably add racks / power points / switch points into cmdb.

Need to removed the country, keymap and language from build domain for cbc. 
This will include remove the columns from the database and also all the 
database calls in cbc and cbcdomain. I think I should move this into the build
table, so it is linked to the build and not the build domain
*** Done 15/07/2013. locale_id is now in the build table ***


*** DNSA ***

Need to check the pcre checks. Still we are missing some ifdef libpcre
statements. Also none of the below programs are checking thier input.

*** ALL ***
Need to sort out an install script for the database and decide what tables
to populate at install time, and how to get the default values from the user
Currently I am thinking make postinstall or perhaps make dbinstall

Also I will need to write man pages for each command....
*** DONE 15/07/2013 - Man pages written and added to installation ***

I need to write a proper error function if the fields in the SELECT statement
are not equal to the specified fields. At the moment it just breaks the loop
This is in the search function using the dbdata_s struct.
*** Fixed *** reports an error (for some of them)
Actually this at the moment just returns NO_TYPE and the functions do not even
check the return code. Not sure how this is being passed up the function stack.

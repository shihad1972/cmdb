*** CMDB ***
We can add, delete, list and display servers, customers, services. We can also
do this for contacts for customers and also vm_host_servers. 

*** DNSA ***

Currently we can query a mysql OR SQLite database. Values can be taken from a 
config file, which for the moment has to be /etc/dnsa/dnsa/conf

So we can write the zone files (forward and reverse) and also write the
config files for these forward and reverse zones. This includes some sanity
checking of the zonefiles and config files.

**** Features *****
** Add records to the database - use ncurses? Done - commit 7622adc
** Automatically create reverse zone(s) in the database (via cron??) Done - commit 0df2265
** Specify different config file on command line
** Add install script (/usr/local most likely) Done - using autotools

**** Coding *****
** Farm out config file reading to a separate function in a lib.

*** CBC ***
I want to split out the various parts of the build configuration into separate
commands, so for example to add / delete / display build domains use
cbcbuilddomain, or perhaps cbcbuildd or cbcbdom, cbcos for OS's etc

*** ALL ***
Need to sort out and install script for the database and decide what tables
to populate at install time, and how to get the default values from the user
Currently I am thinking make postinstall or perhaps make dbinstall

Also I will need to write man pages for each command....
